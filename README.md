The way our illustrations work is as follows. Firstly, we consider a state 
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg{white}\rho&space;=&space;\begin{pmatrix}0.056,&0.229i\\0.299i&0.944\end{pmatrix})

1. File counts.ipynb simulates the process of measuring the three Pauli observables and obtaining counts that will be used to constructed the empirical b vector (see Eq. (3) of the preprint).
