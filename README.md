# Bilevel State Tomography

This is a repository companion to the preprint "Quantum State Tomography as a Bilevel Problem" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03448).

The way our illustrations work is as follows. We consider a state œÅ (corresponding to a qubit).

1. File counts.ipynb simulates the process of measuring the three Pauli observables and obtaining counts that will be used to constructed the empirical b vector (see Eq. (3) of the preprint).
